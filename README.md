Description

This plugin makes events happen in your minecraft world! You can manually make these events happen with the /event command, but they also randomly happen throughout the minecraft day once a day every day. The events are as followed:
- RandomTeleportation: This teleports everyone on the server to a new random location in the world they are currently in.
- Apocalypse: When this event happens every player has a 50/50 chance that a lot of zombies will spawn around them.
- MineralRain: When this event happens every player will have gold, iron, and coal drop down on them!
- AcidRain: When this event occurs it will rain for 30 seconds, if you are in the rain you will recieve poison from the acid.
- StrobeLight: This event makes every players screen flash thus creating a strobe light! Time to dance!

At the beginning of every day the time that the random event will occur is printed in console of the server.
